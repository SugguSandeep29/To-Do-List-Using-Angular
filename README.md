# To-Do-List-Using-Angular
WEB ENGINEERING 

Akshay is not good at remembering things. He often forgets the tasks to
complete and he needs your help in making a To-do Application for him to
keep track of his tasks. He needs the below mentioned features in the app.
● Adding a task in to-do list.
● Removing a task from the list.
As suggested Akshay is not good at remembering multiple links so make a
Single Page Application using Angular.


Akshay liked your To-Do App but he has a new problem. He is removing list items
and unable to recall what was removed. So he needs following changes to your To-Do
App.
● A list to the right which includes Completed tasks.
● A Restore option to bring back the item from the completed list.
Akshay likes to have animations in the app make sure you have some animation for all
3 operations (Add, Remove, Restore item).
